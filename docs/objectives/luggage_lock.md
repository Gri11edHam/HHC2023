    Hey there, I'm Garland Candlesticks! I could really use your help with something.<br>
    You see, I have this important pamphlet in my luggage, but I just can't remember the combination to open it!<br>
    Chris Elgee gave a talk recently that might help me with this problem. Did you attend that?<br>
    I seem to recall Chris mentioning a technique to figure out the combinations...<br>
    I have faith in you! We'll get that luggage open in no time.<br>
    This pamphlet is crucial for me, so I can't thank you enough for your assistance.<br>
    Once we retrieve it, I promise to treat you to a frosty snack on me!

## Hints

??? tip "Lock Talk"
    Check out Chris Elgee's [talk](https://youtu.be/ycM1hBSEyog) regarding his and his wife's luggage.  Sounds weird but interesting!

## Solution

Start by selecting the "Four wheels" difficulty then clicking "Play!"

![Start Menu](../img/objectives/luggage_lock/start_menu.png)

Next push the button 3 or 4 steps down.

![Lock Button](../img/objectives/luggage_lock/lock_button.png)

Rotate the dials with the ++"q"++, ++"w"++, ++"e"++, and ++"r"++ keys. When the dial resists, take note of the number. Whichever number seems to resists the most is probably the correct number.

![Dial Resistance](../img/objectives/luggage_lock/dial_resistance.png)

After all the dials seem correct, push the button all the way down and the lock should open.
