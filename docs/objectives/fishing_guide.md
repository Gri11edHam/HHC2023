??? quote "Poinsettia McMittens"
    Excuse me, but you're interrupting my fishing serenity. Oh, you'd like to know how to become as good at fishing as I am?<br>
    Well, first of all, thank you for noticing my flair for fishing. It's not just about looking good beside the lake, you know.<br>
    The key is in the details, much like crafting the perfect toy. Observe the water, the weather, and the fish’s habits - it's a science and an art.<br>
    Of course, it helps to have a natural charm. Fish seem to find me irresistible. Must be my sparkling personality... or maybe it's just the glitter of my allure.<br>
    Oh, the mysteries of the aquatic life around these islands are as elusive as, well, a clever compliment. But you'll get one if you probe enough.<br>
    Remember, patience is more than a virtue in fishing; it’s a strategy. Like waiting for the right time to use flattery, you wait for the right moment to strike.<br>
    Go see if you can catch, say, 20 different types of fish!
